Potential autoimpedance circuit improvements

1. There should be some extra, auxiliary MUX paths tied to various onboard dummy loads (e.g. 10k, 100k, 1M) for gain-factor calibration verification and internal phase measurements (see pgs. 17-19 of AD5933 datasheet).

2. There should be more test points on the circuit.

	> For testing digital pot resistance
	> Power rails
	> I2C bus sockets

3. There should be more information on the silkscreen layers - i.e. component values. 

4. Silk screen font must be larger because print resolution is too course for current size.

5. Do we need a DC blocking cap at the test_out pin of the AD5933 to prevent the DC bias (table 5 of AD5933 datasheet) on test signal from electroplating during the impedance test?

	> EDIT: The DC offset is almost certainly a result of the single supply nature of the ic. The best way to fix this might be to implement a simple virtual ground circuit, and a higher voltage battery to create a negative rail. Then the test signal could be level shifted to 0V. Of course, vgnd would need to drive the saline bath too, so it would have to be a least a little hefty. We could also just send the test signal though an isolator although I doubt Josh will like that approach.

6. What p2p excitation voltage should we be using?

7. Why is the external oscillator required?

	> EDIT: Because the dynamic range with onboard oscillator is 1kHz to 100 kHz, and it is not really accurate in the low end where we need it.
